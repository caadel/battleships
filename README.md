# Battleships

## About

This application allows two players to locally play the classic game [Battleships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). 

[Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are used for package managegment and compilation.

## How to run

To only install what is necessary to compile the app to vanilla JavaScript and use the app, run `npm i typescript` followed by `npx tsc`. 

To install the full development environment (includes e.g. linting and testing), run ``npm i`` followed by ``npm run dev`` instead.

Finally, open the "index.html" file in the root directory to play the game.
